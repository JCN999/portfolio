                <h2>Graphic Designer / Web Designer</h2>

                <p>Hello everyone! My name is Jean Nunez and I am both a Graphic Designer and Web Designer. I focus on
                bringing you the best customer service possible as well as the most efficient and eye catching designs there are.
                For about 2 years now, I have worked towards not only expanding my knowledge of certain adobe programs 
                (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator), but also mastering them. Eventually, I would love to build my own clothing brand
                once I am a bit more experienced with not only the design work, but the professionalism that comes with it.
                Below I have included an image of myself as well as a few of my best designs so that you can see what I am able to achieve. I hope you enjoy it!
                </p>

                        so I decided I'd go with grape jelly. I focused on ensuring that the logo could speak that for itself.

                        The topic I chose for the conference was tattoos, which is why I decided to add a tattoo gun into the logo.

                        energy drinks, water bottles, etc.). I decided I would go with an energy drink, so I used bright colors as well as
                        implementing custom made lightning bolts so that it gives the feel of "energy."

                        <p class="text">This project was the final for one of my Graphic Design courses. The final goal was to create
                        a magazine poster on a topic of our choosing. For mine, I decided I would design a front cover for
                        a dog magazine as they are a bit uncommon, and I have yet to see one in the style that I created.

                        <p class="text">For this project, we were instructed to make an event poster with custom orchids from scratch and implement them
                        into our design. I decided I would add them on the sides of the poster to clear up the white space, and in return
                        it brought out a strong design that has a nice flow to it. My favorite part of this project was creating the orchids
                        as it was the first time I worked on making something "realistic" from scratch.

                        <p class="text">Probably one of my most unique designs! Since the topic for this project was a gaming conference, I figured that
                        the best way to implement that was by adding pixelated text and elements. On top of that, a pixelated heart
                        (like the one I created) is usually associated with games as that is where you most commonly see it, and anyone
                        who is interested in an event of that type would instantly recognize it.

                        <p class="text">This project is one of my most recent designs. The goal for this was to create a Sci-Fi movie poster of our
                        choosing. The entire project was to be done in photoshop, which is my preferred program to use. Every element
                        in this project, other than the background, was created entirely from scratch using different design techniques
                        that I have learned throught my years of designing. By far, this is one of my favorite designs that I have made.

                        <p class="text">Designing this poster was enjoyable from start to finish! This project was one of the first that I did, however
                        it is still one of my favorites. We were instructed to create a poster for the NC Zoo, and the rest was up to us. I decided
                        I would begin by implementing the circles that you see, and clipping the images of the animals to it so that the only thing
                        that would be visible is the focal point of each image. There are also subtle paw prints in the background which would assist with the viewing.
                        They were both placed in that manner so that the poster "flows" downwards, which would eventually lead the viewers eye to the NZ Zoo logo.

                        <p class="text">For this project, we were instructed to make a custom font that not only looks good, but is usable and consistent. 
                        This was the first time I have attempted at making a font, and I was quite pleased with the way it turned out. I wanted
                        to keep the font simple, but add numerous elements to each letter so that it stands out compared to other fonts. A font
                        like this would be perfect for a "nature" theme or something of the sort.

                        8-Legged Von Grimbleton) and based off of that we had to create the strongest design possible.

                        I chose an air fryer as I have physical access to one and that makes it much easier to work with. I started off by taking it apart
                        and taking pictures of each part individually so that I could precisely create them in illustrator. This ended up being one of my better
                        designs and helped me learn new techniques that I did not know before.

                        greatly. Below is a link to his portfolio in case you are interested!
